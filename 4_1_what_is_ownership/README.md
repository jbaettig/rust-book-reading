# What Is Ownership?

Ownership is a set of rules that govern how a Rust program manages memory. As a result rust does not need a garbage collector.

In Rsut a variable _owns_ some memory. That means tat in Rust the memory is automatically returned (freed) once the variable that owns it goes out of scope.

## Stack and Heap

When your code calls a function, the values passed into the function (including, potentially, pointers to data on the heap) and the functionâ€™s local variables get pushed onto the stack. When the function is over, those values get popped off the stack.

## Ownerhsip Rules

- Each value in Rust has an owner.
- There can only be one owner at a time.
- When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

## String Type

The string type has a variable length an must be stored on the heap. The `String` type manages data allocation on the heap an can store an amount of text that is unknown at compile time.

```rs
// create a sting from a string literal
// -> 'String::from' requests the memory it needs
let s = String::from("hello");
```

In Rust the memory is automatically returned (freed) once the variable that owns it goes out of scope. This is automatically done by a call of the `drop` function.

## Variables and Data Interacting with Move

What does the following example do?

-> "Bind the value 5 to x; then make a copy of the value in x and bind it to y. We now have two variables, x and y, and both equal 5. The two 5s are on the stack"

```rs
let x = 5;
let y = x;
```

The version with `String` is different however.

```rs
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;
```

A string has three parts on the stack: A pointer to the memory that holds the contents of the string, a length (bytes), and a capacity (bytes).

In the example code above only the pointer, length and capacity are copied. The actual values on the heap do not get copied.

-> When we assign `let s2 = s1` in the code above the variable `s1` is no longer considered valid in rust! We say taht `s1` was _moved_ into `s2`.

## Variables and Data Interacting with Clone

With the `clone()` function one can create a deep copy of a complex data type. This can however be an expensive function call.

```rs
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1.clone();
// s1 was not moved and is still valid
// s2 is a deep copy
println!("s1 = {}, s2 = {}", s1, s2);
```

## Stack-Only Data: Copy

-> Types with known size at compile time always make a deep copy and therefore are not moved like we can see in the example with integers. They implement a trait that is called `Copy`.

## Ownership of Functions

Passing a variable to a function will move or copy, just as assignment does.

```rs
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s comes into scope

    takes_ownership(s);             // s's value moves into the function...
                                    // ... and so is no longer valid here

    let x = 5;                      // x comes into scope

    makes_copy(x);                  // x would move into the function,
                                    // but i32 is Copy, so it's okay to still
                                    // use x afterward

} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. But because s's value was moved, nothing
  // special happens.
```

## Return Values and Scope

Returning a value can also transfer ownership.

```rs
fn main() {
    let s1 = gives_ownership();         // gives_ownership moves its return
                                        // value into s1

    let s2 = String::from("hello");     // s2 comes into scope

    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);  // s2 is moved into
                                        // takes_and_gives_back, which also
                                        // moves its return value into s3
} // Here, s3 goes out of scope and is dropped. s2 was moved, so nothing
  // happens. s1 goes out of scope and is dropped.
```
